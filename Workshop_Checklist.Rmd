## Download and Install RStudio
We will use RStudio in the workshop.
While R comes with its own graphical user interface, the RStudio interface
provides additional functionality and simplifies many tasks. Make sure you install
R **before** installing RStudio!

1. Visit: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
2. You want to install the free RStudio Desktop

## Download Data
Examples in the workshop will use the Community Health Status Indicators dataset 
from Health.gov. Download the data by visiting:
https://www.healthdata.gov/dataset/community-health-status-indicators-chsi-combat-obesity-heart-disease-and-cancer

![](PrepImages/CHSI.png)
Make sure to unzip the download, you should see a folder 'chsi_dataset'.

## Create 'Rworkshop' folder

Please Create a new folder 'Rworkshop' on your *desktop* and move the 'chis_dataset' folder
to this location. 

## Set working directory

We will use the 'Rworkshop' folder as the working directory for reading and
writing files. We will review this at the start of the workshop, but it would be
useful to do in advance.

1. Open RStudio - the appearance may differ somewhat from the screenshot.

2. Use the 'Files' tab on the left or click the arrow to bring up file navigation.
3. Navigate to the Desktop and check the box next to the Rworkshop folder.
4. Select 'More' and choose 'Set as Working Directory'

5. Check that you were successful by typing `getwd()` in the console to the left.
You should see the full path to the 'Rworkshop' folder.

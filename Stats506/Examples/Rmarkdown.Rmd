## Markdown

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a plain text formatting language that is designed to create html 
documents using special characters and indentation to specify the desired format
while remaining easy to read in its raw format. Thanks to the magic of
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) Markdown can also be used to create PDF, MS Word,
and other styles of documents. 

There are many "flavors" of markdown.  Let's look at a quick tutorial on 
<a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Github flavored markdown</a>.

## Rmarkdown
This document was written in [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
using RStudio. You can see the source at [Stats506_F18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbhender/Stats506_F18/master/Examples/Rmarkdown.Rmd).

You will use Rmarkdown for all assignments in the course.  To begin, you should
familarize yourself with the basic formatting options specified under "Examples"
at the page we viewed [earlier](<a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">). A homework
template is available at [Stats506_F18](https://github.com/jbhender/Stats506/).
